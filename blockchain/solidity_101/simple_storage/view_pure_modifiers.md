## Overview

---

The view and pure modifiers in Solidity are special function modifiers that help optimize gas costs and ensure code correctness. They work together to provide different levels of optimization and guarantees about function behavior.

## Modifier Comparison

---

| Modifier | State Access | Gas Cost                    | Use Cases          |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| view     | Read only    | Reduced (200 gas per SLOAD) | • Getting balances |

• Reading mappings
• Querying state |
| pure | None | Minimal | • Mathematical calculations
• Data transformations
• Helper functions |
| Regular | Full access | Standard | • State modifications
• Complex operations
• External calls |

## Detailed Explanations

### View Functions

View functions are designed for reading contract state without modification. They have several key characteristics:

- Can read state variables but cannot modify them

- Incur reduced gas costs (200 gas per SLOAD operation)

- Cannot emit events or make external calls
- Useful for:
  - Getting contract balances
  - Reading mapping values
  - Querying contract state

Example:

```solidity
contract BalanceChecker {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function getBalance(address user) public view returns (uint) {
        return balances[user];  // Can read but not modify
    }
}
```

### Pure Functions

Pure functions are designed for calculations that don't depend on state. They have several key characteristics:

- Cannot read or modify state variables

- Cannot make external calls
- Most gas-efficient option
- Useful for:
  - Mathematical calculations
  - Data transformations
  - Helper functions

Example:

```solidity
contract Calculator {
    function multiply(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
        return a * b;  // No state access
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

---

1. **Use view for State Queries**

   - Always use view for functions that only read state
   - Combine with external for gas optimization
   - Use for getter functions and state queries

2. **Use pure for Calculations**

   - Mark mathematical functions as pure
   - Use for data transformations
   - Helps catch unintended state access

3. **Gas Optimization**

   - view functions cost 200 gas per SLOAD operation
   - pure functions have minimal gas costs
   - Regular functions have standard gas costs

4. **Code Quality**
   - Use modifiers to document function behavior
   - Helps catch bugs at compile time
   - Makes code more maintainable

Remember that while these modifiers help with gas optimization and code clarity, they don't provide security guarantees. Always consider the security implications of your function implementations regardless of their modifiers.

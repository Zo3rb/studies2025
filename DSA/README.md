\***\*DSA (D\*\***ata \***\*S\*\***tructures and \***\*A\*\***lgorithms) is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.

## Why to Learn DSA?

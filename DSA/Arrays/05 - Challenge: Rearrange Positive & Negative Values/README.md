# Rearrange Positive & Negative Values

## Problem Statement

Implement a function that rearranges elements in a list such that all **negative** elements appear to the **left** and all **positive** elements (including zero) appear to the **right**.

It's important to note that maintaining the original sorted order of the input list is **not required** for this task.

### Constraints

- The length of the list is between 1 and 10^3.
- The elements in the list are between -10^5 and 10^5.

## Input

- A list of integers, `lst`, where each element is between -10^5 and 10^5.

## Output

- A list of integers where all negative numbers are to the left and non-negative numbers (including zero) are to the right.

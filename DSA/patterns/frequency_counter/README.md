# [Frequency Counter Pattern](<Frequency Counter Pattern for Programming Problem Solving.pdf>)

The **Frequency Counter** pattern is a technique used to solve problems that involve counting and comparing elements in data structures like arrays or strings. It helps optimize solutions by using objects (or hash maps) to store frequencies instead of using nested loops, which reduces time complexity.

## When to Use

- When solving problems involving comparisons of elements.
- When counting occurrences of elements.
- When checking for anagrams, duplicates, or unique elements in arrays/strings.
- When improving inefficient nested loops.

## How It Works

1. Use a **hash map (object/dictionary)** to store the frequency of elements.
2. Iterate through the input and populate the hash map.
3. Use the frequency map to compare, manipulate, or derive conclusions efficiently.

## Advantages

âœ… Reduces time complexity from **O(nÂ²)** (nested loops) to **O(n)** (single pass using hash maps).  
âœ… Improves efficiency in large datasets.  
âœ… Simplifies logic and enhances readability.

## Key Takeaways

- Use a **hash map (dictionary/object)** to count occurrences efficiently.
- Eliminates the need for **nested loops**, reducing time complexity.
- Works well for problems involving **comparison, counting, and unique elements**.

By mastering the **Frequency Counter** pattern, you can optimize many common algorithm problems efficiently! ðŸš€

# Common Problem Solving Patterns

The **Common Problem Solving Patterns** folder contains various algorithmic patterns that provide efficient solutions to common programming problems. These patterns help in solving problems systematically by following structured approaches.

## Why Use Patterns?

- üöÄ Improve problem-solving efficiency.
- üß† Develop structured thinking for tackling coding challenges.
- ‚è≥ Reduce time complexity by applying optimized techniques.
- üìö Enhance coding interview preparation.

## Included Patterns

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Frequency Counter

- **Description:** Uses a hash map (object/dictionary) to count occurrences and compare elements efficiently.
- **Use Cases:** Anagram detection, finding duplicates, counting unique values.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sliding Window

- **Description:** Optimizes problems involving subarrays or substrings by maintaining a window that slides through the data.
- **Use Cases:** Finding the longest substring, maximum sum subarray, fixed or dynamic window problems.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Two Pointers

- **Description:** Uses two pointers to traverse a structure, reducing the need for nested loops.
- **Use Cases:** Pair sum, merging sorted arrays, palindrome checking.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Recursion

- **Description:** Solves problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively.
- **Use Cases:** Tree traversal, backtracking, generating permutations.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Divide and Conquer

- **Description:** Divides a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines results.
- **Use Cases:** Merge sort, quick sort, binary search.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Programming (DP)

- **Description:** Breaks problems into subproblems, stores results to avoid recomputation.
- **Use Cases:** Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, longest common subsequence.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Backtracking

- **Description:** Explores all possibilities and backtracks upon reaching an invalid state.
- **Use Cases:** Sudoku solver, N-Queens problem, word search.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Greedy Algorithm

- **Description:** Makes locally optimal choices at each step to find the global optimum.
- **Use Cases:** Huffman encoding, coin change problem, activity selection.

## How to Use This Folder

1. Each pattern has its own directory containing:
   - A README.md explaining the pattern.
   - Code implementations in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
   - Example problems and solutions.
2. Start with a pattern and practice problems related to it.
3. Try implementing problems before referring to the solutions.

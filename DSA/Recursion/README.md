# Recursion - A Complete Overview

## What is Recursion?

**Recursion** is a programming concept where a function calls itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a larger problem by breaking it down into smaller, simpler subproblems.

In simpler terms, recursion is when a function solves a small piece of the problem and relies on itself to solve the rest.

## What Makes a Function Recursive?

A function is called **recursive** if:

1. It **calls itself** (directly or indirectly).
2. It has a **base case** to terminate the recursive calls.
3. It **breaks down the problem** into smaller instances of itself.

Without a base case, recursion would go on infinitely and cause a **stack overflow**.

## Types of Recursion (Explained Deeply)

1. **Linear Recursion**

   - In linear recursion, a function makes **one** recursive call per call.
   - Each call solves a part of the problem and passes the reduced problem to the next call.
   - **Example**: Calculating the factorial of a number.

2. **Tail Recursion**

   - A special case of linear recursion where the recursive call is the **last** action in the function.
   - Allows certain optimizations where the stack frame can be reused.
   - **Example**: Tail-recursive factorial function.

3. **Binary Recursion**

   - A function makes **two** recursive calls at each step.
   - Used when a problem naturally splits into two subproblems.
   - **Example**: Calculating the Fibonacci sequence.

4. **Multiple Recursion**

   - A generalized form of binary recursion where a function makes **more than two** recursive calls.
   - Often seen in complex tree traversals.

5. **Indirect Recursion**

   - A function does **not call itself directly** but is called through another function.
   - Function A calls Function B, and Function B calls Function A.

6. **Mutual Recursion**

   - A broader concept where two or more functions call each other in a cycle.
   - Example: Even and Odd checks where `isEven()` calls `isOdd()` and vice versa.

7. **Nested Recursion**

   - A recursion where the argument passed to the recursive function is itself a recursive call.
   - Example: `f(f(x))` instead of `f(x-1)`.

## Real-life Example

- **Russian Dolls**: A big doll contains a smaller doll inside it, which contains another smaller doll inside it, and so on until the smallest doll.
- Each doll represents a function call; opening each doll is like going deeper into recursion.

## How Does a Recursive Function Work?

A recursive function generally consists of **three main parts**:

1. **Base Case**

   - Stops the recursion when a certain condition is met.

2. **Recursive Case**

   - Function calls itself to work toward the base case.

3. **Work Done**

   - Actual work performed at each level (e.g., calculations, operations).

## Visualizing Recursion: Call Stack and Stack Frames

Every function call gets its own **stack frame** in the **call stack**:

- **Stack Frame**: Stores information about the function's parameters, return address, and local variables.
- **Call Stack**: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure that manages active function calls.

**Example** (Factorial of 3):

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

factorial(3)

```

### Stack Evolution Diagram

```bash
Call: factorial(3)
  -> factorial(2)
    -> factorial(1)
      -> factorial(0)
        -> returns 1
      <- returns 1 * 1 = 1
    <- returns 2 * 1 = 2
  <- returns 3 * 2 = 6

```

Step

Call Stack

Start

factorial(3)

Calls factorial(2)

factorial(3) -> factorial(2)

Calls factorial(1)

factorial(3) -> factorial(2) -> factorial(1)

Calls factorial(0)

factorial(3) -> factorial(2) -> factorial(1) -> factorial(0)

factorial(0) returns

factorial(3) -> factorial(2) -> factorial(1)

factorial(1) returns

factorial(3) -> factorial(2)

factorial(2) returns

factorial(3)

factorial(3) returns

(Call Stack empty)

> Think of the stack as building blocks: recursion builds the stack upward (function calls) and then deconstructs it downward (return values).

### Visual Representation

```bash
Push Calls onto Stack:
    factorial(3)
    factorial(2)
    factorial(1)
    factorial(0)

Pop Calls off Stack:
    factorial(0) returns 1
    factorial(1) returns 1
    factorial(2) returns 2
    factorial(3) returns 6

```

## How to Convert Any Loop into a Recursive Function

Follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable**

   - Example: `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)`

2. **Define the Base Case**

   - When should the recursion stop?

3. **Define the Recursive Case**

   - Move towards the base case by changing parameters.

4. **Make the Recursive Call**

   - Instead of moving to the next iteration, call the function with the updated parameter.

**Example** (Loop to Recursion)

From Loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

To Recursion:

```javascript
function printNumbers(i, n) {
  if (i > n) return;
  console.log(i);
  printNumbers(i + 1, n);
}

printNumbers(0, n);
```

## Summary

Recursion is a powerful and elegant approach to problem-solving. However, it must be used carefully, always defining a proper base case to avoid infinite recursion. By understanding how the call stack and stack frames work, you can write efficient and clear recursive solutions.

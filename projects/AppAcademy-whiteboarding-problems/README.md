## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains a curated list of JavaScript functions to implement and practice key data structures, algorithmic patterns, and coding interview fundamentals. These problems are **not** included in automated assessments but are **common in technical interviews**.

Each problem encourages:

- Applying **Polya's Problem Solving Framework**:

  1. Understand the problem
  2. Devise a plan
  3. Carry out the plan
  4. Look back and refactor

- Analyzing **time and space complexity**
- Exploring **more optimal solutions**

## ðŸ“š How to Use This Repository

1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Solve problems one by one, starting from the top.
3. For each function:

   - Understand the problem statement.
   - Write your implementation.
   - Determine time and space complexity.
   - Refactor if necessary.

4. (Optional) Add test cases to verify edge cases.

## ðŸŽ“ Recommended Practices

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names.
- Avoid built-in methods unless allowed.
- After solving, review your approach for optimizations.
- Discuss your thought process, just like in a real interview.

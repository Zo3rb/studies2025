# Challenge 1: Even or Odd Checker

## 📜 Description

Create a Bash script that:

1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Checks whether the entered number is **even** or **odd**.
3. Prints the appropriate message based on the result.

## 📝 Example Usage

```bash
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```

```bash
Enter a number: 10
10 is an even number.
```

## 🔹 Instructions

- **Use Bash scripting best practices.**
- **Validate user input** to ensure it's a number.
- **Keep the script simple and efficient.**
- **Avoid unnecessary computations.**

## 💡 Hints

- Use the modulo (`%`) operator to determine even or odd.
- Remember that a number is even if `number % 2 == 0`.
